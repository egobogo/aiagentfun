project:
  goal: "Our project is an AI-powered agile team management platform built in Go. It autonomously orchestrates team interactions by assigning tasks to specialized AI agents—such as a Product Manager Assistant, Engineering Manager, Researcher, Designer, and FrontEnd Developer, BackEnd Developer, QA, Marketer, each with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The system continuously refines requirements through iterative summarization and context updates, integrating inputs from tools like agile boards and Git. By maintaining a dynamic, shared context and following a hierarchical, sequential workflow, the platform minimizes context switching and enables focused, efficient execution of project tasks."
